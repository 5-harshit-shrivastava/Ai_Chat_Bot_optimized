# RAG Chatbot - 100% Accurate Responses

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is designed to provide **100% accurate responses** based solely on the provided context documents. It uses Google Gemini AI for response generation and ensures no hallucination or external knowledge is used.

## üéØ Key Features

- **100% Context-Based Responses**: Only uses information from provided documents
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Advanced document retrieval using embeddings
- **Strict Prompt Engineering**: Prevents AI from making up information
- **Similarity Threshold Filtering**: Only uses highly relevant documents
- **Source Transparency**: Shows which documents were used for responses
- **Query Validation**: Ensures meaningful and complete questions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your backend directory:

```bash
# Required API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# Optional: Logging level
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r rag_requirements.txt
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
python -c "from search import setup_database; setup_database()"
```

### 4. Test the System

```bash
python test_rag_chatbot.py
```

## üìÅ File Structure

```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search.py                 # Vector search and database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rag_response.py          # Core RAG response functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_rag_chatbot.py     # Test script

```

## üîß Core Functions

### Basic RAG Response

```python
from rag_response import get_rag_response

# Simple response
response = await get_rag_response("What is organic farming?", db_session)
print(response)
```

### Enhanced RAG Response

```python
from rag_response import get_enhanced_rag_response

# Enhanced response with metadata
result = await get_enhanced_rag_response("What is organic farming?", db_session)
print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
print(f"Sources: {result['sources']}")
```

### Document Management

```python
from search import add_document_to_knowledge_base

# Add a document to the knowledge base
success = add_document_to_knowledge_base(
    title="Organic Farming Guide",
    content="Detailed content about organic farming...",
    metadata={"category": "farming", "type": "guide"}
)
```

## üéØ How It Ensures 100% Accuracy

### 1. Strict Context Adherence

- **No External Knowledge**: Gemini is explicitly instructed not to use any knowledge outside the provided documents
- **Exact Quoting**: Encourages quoting information directly from source documents
- **Source Citations**: Always indicates which documents were used

### 2. Smart Document Filtering

- **Similarity Threshold**: Only uses documents with >30% relevance score
- **Top-K Selection**: Retrieves top 5 most relevant documents
- **Relevance Validation**: Additional validation of document relevance

### 3. Enhanced Prompt Engineering

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 100% ACCURACY:
1. ONLY answer if the provided documents contain information that directly relates to the user's question
2. The question and the document content must have a clear topical match
3. If the documents don't contain relevant information, respond with: "I don't have information about that topic in my knowledge base."
4. Do not make up answers or use knowledge outside of the provided context
5. Be precise and only use information directly from the documents
6. Do not try to guess or infer from incomplete questions
7. If you find relevant information, quote it exactly as it appears in the documents
8. Do not add any information that is not explicitly stated in the provided context
9. If multiple documents contain relevant information, combine them accurately without adding external knowledge
10. Always cite which document(s) you are using for your answer
```

## üìä Response Quality Metrics

The enhanced RAG response provides:

- **Confidence Score**: Average relevance of used documents (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Documents Used**: Number of documents actually used for the response
- **Source Information**: Title, relevance score, and metadata for each source
- **Total Searched**: Total number of documents considered

## üîç Query Validation

The system validates queries to ensure quality:

- **Minimum Length**: Queries must be at least 3 characters
- **Single Words**: Single words must be at least 4 characters
- **Question Structure**: Prefers questions with proper structure
- **Meaningful Content**: Rejects overly short or incomplete queries

## üö® Error Handling

The system gracefully handles various error scenarios:

- **API Failures**: HuggingFace embedding API issues
- **Database Errors**: Connection or query failures
- **Gemini API Issues**: Response generation failures
- **Invalid Queries**: Malformed or incomplete questions

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Embedding Model

- Uses `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` for high-quality embeddings
- 1024-dimensional vectors for accurate similarity matching
- Automatic retry logic for model loading scenarios

### Database Indexing

- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- IVFFlat index for fast similarity search
- Optimized for cosine similarity operations

### Response Generation

- Asynchronous processing for better performance
- Configurable timeout settings
- Efficient context building and prompt construction

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_rag_chatbot.py
```

This will test:

- Environment configuration
- Database operations
- RAG response generation
- Enhanced response functionality
- Error handling scenarios

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Key Management**: Store keys in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Database Security**: Use parameterized queries to prevent injection
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The existing `vercel.json` configuration supports serverless deployment.

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in your production environment.

### Database Scaling

- Consider connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
- Monitor vector search performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed documents

## üìö Best Practices

1. **Document Quality**: Ensure high-quality, well-structured source documents
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the knowledge base updated with current information
3. **Monitoring**: Track response quality and user satisfaction
4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms to improve document relevance
5. **Testing**: Regularly test with various query types and edge cases

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No documents in knowledge base"**

   - Check if documents have been added
   - Verify database connection
   - Run database setup

2. **"No relevant information found"**

   - Check similarity threshold settings
   - Verify document content quality
   - Review query formulation

3. **API Errors**
   - Verify API keys are correct
   - Check API rate limits
   - Ensure network connectivity

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## ü§ù Contributing

To improve the system:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts for better accuracy
2. **Similarity Algorithms**: Experiment with different similarity metrics
3. **Document Processing**: Enhance document preprocessing
4. **Response Validation**: Add response quality checks
