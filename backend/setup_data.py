For wheat crops, a balanced NPK ratio of 120:60:40 kg/ha is recommended. Apply nitrogen in split doses - 50% at sowing, 25% at tillering, and 25% at grain filling stage. Phosphorus should be applied as basal dose during sowing. Potassium can be applied basally or in split doses.",

            "content": "Organic fertilizers improve soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity. Farmyard manure (FYM) applied at 10-15 tonnes per hectare enhances soil organic matter. Compost provides slow-release nutrients and improves soil biology. Green manures like dhaincha and sunhemp fix nitrogen and add organic matter. Vermicompost contains beneficial microorganisms and provides balanced nutrition.",

            "content": "Nitrogen deficiency appears as yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), starting from leaf tips. Plants show stunted growth and reduced tillering. To correct nitrogen deficiency, apply urea at 50-75 kg/ha or use ammonium sulfate. Side-dress application during active growth periods is most effective. Foliar application of 2% urea solution can provide quick relief.",

Single Super Phosphate (SSP) and Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) are common phosphorus sources. Apply phosphorus fertilizers close to seed placement for better uptake. Rock phosphate is suitable for acidic soils.",

Muriate of Potash (MOP) and Sulfate of Potash (SOP) are primary potassium sources. SOP is preferred for chloride-sensitive crops. Apply potassium in multiple splits for better utilization.",

Apply zinc sulfate at 25 kg/ha for zinc-deficient soils. Iron deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis, treatable with iron chelates. Boron deficiency affects flowering and fruit set.",

Use deep placement of urea super granules (USG) for better nitrogen efficiency. Apply phosphorus and potassium as basal dose. Split nitrogen application: 50% basal, 25% at tillering, 25% at panicle initiation.",

Test soil every 2-3 years for accurate fertilizer recommendations. pH affects nutrient availability - most crops prefer pH 6.0-7.5. Acidic soils need lime application. Alkaline soils require sulfur or organic matter. Based on soil test results, adjust fertilizer rates accordingly.",
